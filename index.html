    <h2>From My Heart</h2>
    <div class="letter-text">
        <p>To Jedidiah, the one this world couldn’t deserve</p>

        <p>This site isn’t just for you. It is you.<br>
        Every color, every corner, every word I built this because I needed a place where my love for you could breathe.</p>

        <p>You are more than just the woman I love.<br>
        You are the gentlest silence in my loudest thoughts.<br>
        You are the reason I wake up with a steadier heart and fall asleep with something to dream about.</p>

        <p>You’re the storm and the stillness, the ache and the answer.<br>
        You walked into my life without asking for space, but somehow, you made room for light in every part of me.</p>

        <p>If there was a language strong enough to hold how I feel about you, I would speak only that.<br>
        If there was a place far enough to escape this world with you, I’d take you there and never look back.</p>

        <p>But here’s something I need to say honestly <br>
        You might not hear from me for a while.</p>

        <p>Not because my love has faded.<br>
        Not because anything changed.<br>
        But because sometimes life pulls us in directions we didn’t plan for.<br>
        And I need you to know that even when I’m gone from the screen or silent for days,<br>
        you are still the first thought that touches my mind when I wake up<br>
        and the last whisper my soul holds onto when I fall asleep.</p>

        <p>This space is my promise.<br>
        When the words can’t reach you, this will.</p>

        <p>So read this when you miss me.<br>
        Look around and remember: I didn’t build this for the world.<br>
        I built it for you.</p>
